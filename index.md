## ABSTRACT
The physical classroom learning is antiquated for the current younger generations (Gen Y) that have been exposed to mobile phones, internet and PC's from a young age have become reliant on them. The internet and distant learning, often known as online education, play an important part in the education system of the country.. It is undeniable that online education provides ample benefits to young learners. 
Many of the educational platforms have implemented their own way of interactions with the students and content creators (Teachers/Instructors).The downside is that there is a great need for changes that can make life easy for instructors as well as for the students. The project tries to achieve this by building a secure platform using blockchain technology and providing certificates that can be easily verified. The immutability, provenance, and peer-executed smart contracts qualities of a blockchain could provide a new level of security, trust, and transparency to e-learning.. The platform uses a pay as you go(PAYG) model where users pay only for content they watch, not for the whole course, intending to make it affordable for students from lower income families. The project uses smart contracts to provide immutable certificates that can be verified and credits can be assigned for completing these courses.The platform can be further improved to become a platform where they can discuss with fellow peers and where students can get started with very little financial investment and still access courses they like.Through better funding the project can be deployed on a very large scale for betterment of students.

## Statement of the Problem:
In the existing educational platforms, we generally observe that we subscribe to the entire course paying the full amount upfront. And E-Learning platforms filled with lots of courses, some are even uploaded by non-genuine sources. The content that is created and delivered by an instructor can be recorded and is being used in unethical ways. There is a need for an analytics dashboard given to the instructors for a  them to know the quality of their course, which part of the course they should try to focus more on. There is a need for limited access criteria implemented i.e. if a student is renting the educational content instead of him buying it, it will cost much less to him as well as curb the redistribution of copyright content.
