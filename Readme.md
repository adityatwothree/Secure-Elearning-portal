# Secure E-learning portal 
## Project overview
Online learning is booming in current times. Aided by the widespread availability of high-speed internet, making use of new technologies such as 4G and the soon-to-be-released 5G, online learning is expected to grow by leaps and bounds in the foreseeable future. By e-learning, we mean the use of electronic technologies for teaching and learning, more specifically creating a platform where students can engage in learning through pre-recorded or live lectures
